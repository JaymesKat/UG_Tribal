     <img src="images/dance.jpg" width="100%" height="200" alt="dressing">     
     <p> Baakisiimba, Nankasa, Muwogola is the original dance that originated from the palace of the king of Buganda. The Kabaka greatly enjoyed local beer(Tonto omwenge) made from banana plants and in so doing would drink too much and get happy read drunk as no one was allowed to say the king was drunk.
         After getting drunk the king would start praising the people who made the drink, saying abaakisiimba bebaakiwoomya, which means "Those who planted it made it delicious."
         The musicians at the gathering created an akaakisiimba rhythm that imitated the words of the king who was happy and relaxed that he began to dance.
         While the musicians mimicked the king's words on their drums, the women imitated the king's movements which eventually became a dance that is now performed throughout Buganda by all generations.
         There are three major movements in this dance: the first is Baakisiimba, the secondis Nankasa, and the third is Muwogola.</p>

   <h3>Bark Cloth (Olubugo): Buganda's Vintage Dress</h3>
  <p><img src="images/barkcloth.jpg">
  <br/>
  The original Buganda dressing was the Olubugo which was discovered during the generation of Kabaka Kintu, the first king of Buganda who reigned around the second generation of the Stone Age period.
  
  <p class="clear"><h4>How Olubugo is made</h4>  
  Bark cloth making is an ancient craft performed by Ngonge clan that manufactures the Bark cloth for the Royal clan and the rest of the community.
  The inner bark of the Mutuba tree(ficus natalensis) is harvested during the wet season and then in a long strenuous process, beaten by with different types of wooden mallets to make it texture soft and fine and give it an even terracotta colour.</p>
  <h4>Significance and Use</h4>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/Buganda Drums.jpg">The Olubugo was traditionally popular for clothing, beddings and as a wrapper for the dead.
  It can also be used as analternative to canvas by painters due to its varying textures and unique lasting capabilities when well handled.
  </p>
  
  <p class="clear"><h4>End of an Era</h4>
  With the introduction of cotton cloth by Arab traders in the nineteenth century, production slowed downed and eventually faded out reducing the wearing of Bark cloth to particular cultural and spiritual functions. </p>
