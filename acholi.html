         <h3>Origins</h3>
        <p class="clear"><img src="images/acholi/home.jpg"style align="middle"></p>
        	 <p> The Acholi is a River-Nilotic tribe, part of the Nilotic group that came into Uganda from Bar El Gazel.<br/>
             They settled in the Northern region of Uganda that comprise of districts like Gulu, Kitgum, Pader, Lamwo.
             They were originally pastoralists who came into Uganda in search for water but eventually ended up taking agriculture as their main activity.
          <br/><br/>The Acholi people are predominantly dark skinned with the exception of a few light-skinned individuals. This is attributed to the semi-aridity of the areas where they settled that receives alot of sunshine.<br/>
    
             </p>
<h3>Life of the Acholi</h3>
        <p class="clear"> <img src="images/acholi/millet.jpg">
            The Acholi are generally known for their humble and hardworking nature.   They engage in agricultural activities but especially food farming for survival.<br>
They practice subsistence farming.<br>
Their stable food is Millet (Kalo)</p>
            <p class="clear"><img src="images/acholi/cook.jpg" width="180px">The Acholi have a very rich culture and encourage togetherness.<br/>
  They are united and ensure that by having gatherings in the evenings over a fire place.The men go out hunting while the females remain at home fetching water and cooking food<br/></p><p class="clear"><img src="images/acholi/achol.jpg" width="180px">
  At that time, elders tell stories to the young ones and also give teachings. This enables the children to preserve the culture.<br/>
  Also, at around that time, dances can be organised and thats when girls have to impress their potential suitors.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">The tradition of the Acholi dances is an invaluable treasure which has enriched the history of art and culture for generations<br/>
        Dance has always been the purest manifestation of the Acholi cultural progress and reflects in a unique way the fine blendings of history, the present, future and a general expression of philosphy in the life of Acholi people.<br/>
        Acholi dances have a subtlety about them and are known for their universal appeal.The dances comprise of Larakaraka, Bwola, and Dingi-Dingi.
        <h3>The Bwola dance of the Acholi</h3><img src="images/acholi/acholi-dancers.jpg"/>
            
            Bwola is a court dance (in the king's palace). This is a circular dance that is performed by the older men and women, and the circle represents a fence that surrounds the palace court. Many events and conversations take place during this dance, so it may last for many hours. </p>
            
        
         <p class="clear"><h3>The Larakaraka dance</h3><img src="images/acholi/ugdance_5.gif"/> 
          Larakaraka is a ceremonial dance from the Acholi. It is primarily a courtship dance that is performed during weddings. <br/>When the young people in a particular village are ready for marriage, they organize a big ceremony where all potential partners meet. As a sign of friendship, food and alcoholic drinks are served during this ceremony.<br/> Only the best dancers will get partners, so there is a lot of competition during the dancing. In Acholi, if you are a poor dancer, you are likely to die as a bachelor.</p> 
        <h3>The Dingi-Dingi Dance</h3>
         <p><img src="images/acholi/ugdance_7.gif"/>
         The Dingi Dingi dance is performed by the young girls of the Acholi, and their movements are meant to imitate birds. The girls dance to attract the young boys, so the dance is usually held on bright days, when the sun is out.

       <p>The Malakwang sauce is prepared by collecting fresh leaves of the naturally growing plant,boiling it and adding simsim/g-nut paste to the ready leaves. This gives the sauce a thick texture and the sauce is then preferably enjoyed with Kalo .</p><br/>
