        <h3>Ekizino dance</h3>
        	<p ><img src="images/bakiga/dances.jpg"/>Ekizino is a court dance from the Bakiga people of the Kigezi region in southern Uganda. The weather in this region is similar to that of many European mountain countries, and the region is often called the "Switzerland of Africa". During colder seasons, Ekizino is the warm-up dance. Kigezi is a hilly region, the men who go out for farming early in the morning, must jump around for a while to get warm and also stretch their muscles after the hard work. Traditionally, the people also used to stamp the ground until they found signs of water. Therefore, this dance represents their jumping and stamping.</p>

        The stable foods of Bakiga were sorghum, sweet potatoes,beans and peas. They supplemented them with pumpkins, yams, meat and a variety of green vegetables.
        	<h3>Obushera</h3>
           <p class="clear">
           <img src="images/bakiga/bushera1.jpg" style="height:120px; width:80px;"/><br/>Obushera is a well known drink enjoyed by the Bakiga.It has always been a vital part of the Bakiga's way of life. It is prepared from sorghum or millet 'esaano'. It is served in a gourd (enkyeeka) or a half litre mug.<br/>
          <p class="clear"> <h3>Making obushera</h3>
          <img src="images/bakiga/obuuro.jpg"/>There are two ways of making obushera butooko. In one, millet flour is used and the in the other, sorghum flour is used but for both, water is boiled first. A mixture of flour and cold water that was boiled and cooled earlier is thoroughly mixed to form a thick slurry in a bowl. Boiling water is then added, stirring rapidly to produce a smooth enkoomba (porridge). Any solid/non-jelly pieces of millet/sorghum meal that form in the porridge are removed by dropping ekyishandiiko (cooked plantain leaves that may have been used to cook an earlier meal) into the porridge. Some people also sprinkle a little ash from the fire into the bowl
          <br/>After the porridge cools, <i>ekyimeera</i> (yeast) is added and the bowl covered for a night. After about twelve hours, <i>obushera </i> can then be stirred and is ready to drink. </p>
           <h3>Sweet potatoes</h3>
           <p style="clear:both;"><img src="images/bakiga/potats.jpg"/><br/>
          	The Bakiga eat alot of irish potatoes 'obumonde' and sweet potatoes which are highly rich in starch that perhaps partly offers an explanation of their stout and physically strong body appearance.</p>
