         <h3>Origins</h3>
        	<p class="clear"><img src="images/banyoro/bunyoro.jpg">The people of Bunyoro are known as <b>Banyoro (singular Munyoro)</b>. They belong to the Kingdom of Bunyoro-Kitara in western Uganda, in the area to the immediate east of Lake Albert. Their cultural leader is the omukama (king). The entire Bunyoro population is estimated to be 1.4 million.
            The kingdom of Bunyoro-Kitara was established following the collapse of the Empire of Kitara in the 16th century.[3] The founders of Kitara were known as the Abatembuzi, a people who were later succeeded by the Abachwezi. At its height, Bunyoro-Kitara controlled almost the entire region between Lake Victoria, Lake Edward, and Lake Albert. One of many small states in the Great Lakes region the earliest stories of the kingdom having great power comes from the Rwanda area where there are tales of the Banyoro raiding the region under a prince named Cwa around 1520. The power of Bunyoro then faded until the mid seventeenth century when a long period of expansion began, with the empire dominating the region by the early eighteenth century.</p>
           
           <p class="clear"><img src="images/banyoro/banyoro-map.jpg" style="height:100px;">
            Bunyoro-Kitara Kingdom is the districts of Hima, Masindi and Kibale. The native language is Runyoro-Rutooro, a Bantu language. Runyoro-Rutooro is also spoken by the people of Toro (Batooro) Kingdom, whose cultural traditions are similar to those of the nyoro people. </p>

         <h3>Life of the Banyoro</h3>
      <img src="images/banyoro/cereals.jpg"><h4>Economy of Bunyoro.</h4> 
      The economy of Bunyoro Kitara Kingdom thrives on a number of economic activities, prominent among which is large scale commercial farming in tobacco, sugarcane, tea, cereals like maize[inset], rice and ranching. A large area of the Kingdom is covered by  tropical rain forests: Budongo, Kasongoire in, Masindi, Bugoma and  Wambabya in Hoima and Kasaato in Kibaale districts. The forest reserves support various economic activities including lumbering (mahogany, ironwood and other hard wood timbers) and bird tracking. The Kingdom is also rich in wild game in national game reserves, including Murchision National Park, Karuma, Bugungu and the Biiso Eco-tourist center. The area has 43% of the national bio-diversity in the Muchision National Park conservation area alone.</p>

        <h3>Runyege Entongoro dance</h3>
        	<p class="clear"><img src="images/banyoro/Runyege.jpg"/>This is a ceremonial dance from Bunyoro and Toro (Batooro) Kingdom. It is also a courtship dance performed by the youth when it is time for them to choose partners for marriage. The dance was named after the rattles (ebinyege – binyege – entongoro) that are tied on boys’legs to produce percussion – like sound on rhythm. The sound produced by rattles is more exciting as it is well syncopated as the main beat is displaced but everything blending with the song and drum rhythms.</p>
            <img src="images/banyoro/Runyege1.jpg"/> <p>In this culture, people believe that the best dancer represents the best married life. Once upon a time, there was a problem in the Kingdoms when more than 10 men wanted to marry the same beautiful and good-looking girl. What happens is that a very big ceremony is organized and all the male candidates have to come and dance. The girl had to choose the best male dancer. In this culture it is believed that the best dancers also show the best marriage life. It is also to see who is the strongest among the men as families in Africa do not want to give their beautiful girls to weak men, for when there is a period of drought or famine, one should have a husband who will really struggle to see that he looks for water and food. So in this dance the man who gets tired first, loses first and that who dances till the end wins the game. There was a problem when some girls wanted to get married to particular men and these were the men who got tired first - what a pity! The girls did not have a choice, as their parents decide for them whom to marry. The dance also indicates who is the strongest man, and families do not want to give their beautiful daughters to weak men who will struggle to provide food and water when there is a drought. So in this dance, the man who gets tired first loses, and the man who dances until the end, wins. A girl may want to marry a man who gets tired early in the dance, but she has no choice but to marry the winner. </div>
