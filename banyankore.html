         <h3>Origins</h3>
        	 <p> The Banyankore like other Bantu groups have their origins traced back to the Bantu. </p>
    <p> But there is something about the Banyankore that is a little bit odd and hard to believe but yet its true and that is the Banyankore society being divided/ stratified into Bahima (Pastoralists), the Bairu (agriculturalists) and the Batwa/ batwarangoma  (the land owners) who are not so popular in the history of ankore. In fact, the major two distinct ethnicities are the Bahiima and the Bairu. The complex kingdom is believed to be the product of cultural mix between different ethnics i.e. the Bahima and the Banyankore Bairu. </p>
     <h3>Life of the Banyankore</h3>
        <p class="clear"> <img src="images/banyankore/ankole_cattle.jpg">
            The Banyankore are well known for their independent and hardworking nature.   They earn a living by engaging in cattle keeping were they get most of the income by selling and taking their children to school. Their cattle has a common characteristic which is the long shaped horns </p>
            <p class="clear"><img src="images/banyankore/download.jpg" width="180px">From a cow, we see horns being used as a trumpet (Enzamba) which I s an instrument for communication, it is used as a container to keep beads, food and other valuables, and it is a symbol of power and strength in a home and finally it can be used for decoration. Still with the cow, the shoes (ebirato) of the Banyankore were made from cow hide and skin; also the skin was fined and used as fabric before the bark cloth was borrowed from the Buganda and finally the internal parts were also used to carry out rituals and other functions. Without forgetting the milk, meat and other products from the cows and all this made a cow a social tapestry.</p>

        <h3>The Kitaguriro dance of banyankore</h3>
        	<p ><img src="images/banyankore/ankoledance_k01.jpg" style="height:150px"/> Ekitaguriro, this dance comes from the Ankole region. It is an old dance for both men and women. It is occasionally performed to demonstrate the love of the Ankole people for their cattle. This cattle breed has very long horns so making the dance aerial. The singing in this dance is similar to the sounds of the cow. You can even hear the sounds of the milk flowing from the udder of the cow in this dance. The flute that is played during the dance is the same that is used to herd cattle. The stamping movements of the men in this dance are similar to the walking movements of a cow, and the hands of the women just demonstrate the long beautiful horns of the cow.</p><h3>Kimandwa Dance</h3>
            <p ><img src="images/banyankore/ankoledance_k02.jpg" style="height:150px;"/>This is a religous dance of the Bahiru people, a worship dance for the god Okubandwa. Kimandwa is derived from the word „emmandwa“ and means the spirits that people get possessed with during the dance performed in this ritual. They believe that sanity (sacrifices) and happiness (joy and love) which they present with this dance place god in a good relationship with the community.

       <h3>Cow ghee(amashuta)</h3>
       <p><img src="images/banyankore/pot.jpg">Ghee is produced as follows. Butter made from cow's milk is melted over a slow fire and then heated slowly until the separated water boils off. The vessel holding the butter is then allowed to cool; semifluid, clear butterfat, which makes the finest ghee, rises to the top of the melted butter and may be poured off, leaving the curd (precipitated protein) at the bottom of the vessel. The curd, which still contains 50 percent or more butterfat, may be reworked with the addition of peanut oil   to make inferior grades of ghee.when it's made it is then kept in a dry pumpkin shell(ensiibo)</p>
